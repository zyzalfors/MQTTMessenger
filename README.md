# MQTT Messenger

This tool is an instant messaging client based on the MQTT protocol.

It is developed as a single-page HTML application and utilizes the [Eclipse Paho](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript) JavaScript library.

The "vanilla" folder contains the legacy version, while the "vue" folder includes the updated Vue version.

You can access it [here](https://zyzalfors.github.io/MQTTMessenger/index.html).
